Applicable refund against the cancelled order will be credited to your Preline Cash Wallet, which can be further used during your next purchase with us or may be transferred to your respective bank / card / wallet by logging into your Preline Account (further Refund related details are provided below).
In case, even a single product of the order has been shipped, you will not be able to cancel the order (in such cases, user would have to cancel an individual product or complete shipment).
In case, the order contains product(s) such as Guaranteed Savings Offer, Gift Certificate or Digital Products, order level cancellation will not be applicable.
